# Deployment Strategy for Pro-Mac Tiles E-commerce

## üéØ Current Situation
- **Existing site**: promac.ro (old version, currently live)
- **New site**: Your React/Supabase e-commerce platform
- **Deployment platform**: Vercel (FREE) or CPanel (existing hosting)
- **Email service**: Resend

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
- **Hobby Plan**: FREE forever
- **Includes**: 100GB bandwidth, global CDN, automatic HTTPS
- **Perfect for**: Pro-Mac Tiles traffic volume
- **Monthly cost**: $0

### Option 2: CPanel (Cost-conscious)
- **Cost**: $0 (using existing hosting)
- **Setup time**: 30 minutes vs 5 minutes
- **Performance**: Basic vs Premium CDN
- **Maintenance**: Manual vs Automatic

**Recommendation**: Start with Vercel FREE - no cost difference, much better performance.

## üìã What You Need From Your Client

### Option 1: Subdomain for Testing (Recommended)
Ask your client to create a subdomain in their DNS settings:
- `beta.promac.ro` or `test.promac.ro` or `new.promac.ro`

**Client needs to add in DNS:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: beta
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Option 2: Full Domain (When Going Live)
**Client needs to provide either:**
- Access to DNS management panel, OR
- Change nameservers to Vercel's nameservers

## üöÄ Phased Deployment Approach

### Phase 1: Development Testing (Current)
```
Status: NOW
URL: your-project.vercel.app
Features:
- All features work except custom email domains
- Use onboarding@resend.dev for emails
- No domain verification needed
```

### Phase 2: Beta Testing with Subdomain
```
Status: NEXT WEEK
URL: beta.promac.ro
Setup Required:
1. Client creates subdomain
2. Add domain in Vercel dashboard
3. Password protect the site
4. Test all features with real domain
```

### Phase 3: Production Launch
```
Status: WHEN READY
URL: promac.ro
Steps:
1. Remove password protection
2. Switch DNS from old site to new
3. Verify domain in Resend for custom emails
4. Monitor and fix any issues
```

## üîí Password Protection Implementation

### Already Created for You:
- `src/middleware/PasswordProtection.tsx` - Password gate component

### How to Enable:
1. Wrap your App.tsx with PasswordProtection:
```tsx
// In App.tsx
import PasswordProtection from './middleware/PasswordProtection'

function App() {
  const isDevelopment = import.meta.env.VITE_ENVIRONMENT === 'beta'
  
  if (isDevelopment) {
    return (
      <PasswordProtection>
        {/* Your existing app */}
      </PasswordProtection>
    )
  }
  
  return (
    // Your existing app
  )
}
```

2. Set password in `.env`:
```env
VITE_BETA_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=beta
```

## üìß Email Service Setup

### Current (Testing):
- **From address**: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- **Works**: Yes, immediately
- **Limitation**: Can't use custom domain

### Production (With Domain):
1. **Add domain to Resend**:
   - Login to Resend
   - Add `promac.ro` as verified domain
   - Add DNS records they provide

2. **DNS Records Needed** (example):
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Resend will provide]

Type: TXT  
Name: @
Value: resend-verification=[code]
```

3. **After verification**:
   - Can send from `contact@promac.ro`
   - Better deliverability
   - Professional appearance

## üõ†Ô∏è Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Project:
```bash
# Build locally to test
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### 2. Initial Deploy:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy "~/tiles-ecommerce"? [Y/n] y
# ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [Your Team]
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
# ? What's your project's name? tiles-ecommerce
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./
# ? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n
```

### 3. Production Deploy:
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Add Custom Domain in Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add `beta.promac.ro`
3. Vercel will show DNS records needed
4. Client adds these to their DNS

### 3. Environment Variables in Vercel:
Add all your `.env` variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
- `VITE_BETA_PASSWORD`
- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT`

## üìù DNS Configuration Request Template

Send this to your client:

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Clarifications

### About Domain Requirements:

1. **What works WITHOUT custom domain**:
   - Everything in the app
   - Supabase auth
   - Database operations
   - Contact form (sends from resend.dev)

2. **What needs custom domain**:
   - Sending emails from @promac.ro
   - Better SEO
   - Professional appearance
   - SSL certificate (automatic with Vercel)

3. **You DON'T need domain for**:
   - Development
   - Testing features
   - Admin functionality
   - Database operations

### Common Misconceptions:
- ‚ùå "Newsletter needs domain to work" ‚Üí Works with resend.dev address
- ‚ùå "Can't test without domain" ‚Üí Can test everything on vercel.app URL
- ‚ùå "Need full domain access immediately" ‚Üí Subdomain is perfect for testing
- ‚úÖ "Custom domain needed for professional emails" ‚Üí This is correct

## üìû Support & Next Steps

1. **Tomorrow's Testing Plan**:
   - Deploy to Vercel (works immediately)
   - Test all features on `.vercel.app` URL
   - Ask client for subdomain when ready

2. **Email Setup Priority**:
   - Keep using `onboarding@resend.dev` for now
   - Verify domain in Resend when client provides access
   - Switch to `contact@promac.ro` after verification

3. **Timeline Suggestion**:
   - Week 1: Test on Vercel URL
   - Week 2: Add subdomain, password protect
   - Week 3-4: Client testing and feedback
   - Week 5: Go live on main domain

Remember: You can develop and test EVERYTHING right now without the domain. The domain is only needed for:
- Professional email addresses
- Public access
- SEO purposes

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components
- **Database Schema**: All tables created with proper indexes and RLS policies
- **Cart Sync Service**: Real-time synchronization between client and server
- **Edge Function**: Email scheduling and template rendering
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Token-based cart recovery with discount support
- **Email Templates**: 3-stage campaign with Romanian localization
- **Testing Suite**: E2E tests for critical flows

### ⏳ Pending Setup (Step 4 - Cron Job)
The cron job scheduling will be configured later. Until then, you can manually trigger the Edge Function for testing.

## 📝 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Launch:

#### 1. **Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Edge Functions
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
SITE_URL=https://promac.ro
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### 2. **Database Verification**
```sql
-- Verify all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('carts', 'cart_items', 'abandoned_cart_emails', 'cart_recovery_tokens');

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('carts', 'cart_items', 'abandoned_cart_emails', 'cart_recovery_tokens');
```

#### 3. **Email Domain Configuration**
- Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for `promac.ro`
- Add `noreply@promac.ro` as verified sender in Resend
- Set up email bounce handling

#### 4. **Test Manual Trigger** (Before Cron Setup)
```bash
# Test the Edge Function manually
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-abandoned-carts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### 1. **Cart Abandonment Flow**
- [ ] Add items to cart as anonymous user
- [ ] Wait 31+ minutes without activity
- [ ] Verify cart status changes to 'abandoned' in database
- [ ] Manually trigger Edge Function
- [ ] Check if email is queued/sent

#### 2. **Recovery Flow**
- [ ] Click recovery link from email
- [ ] Verify cart is restored correctly
- [ ] Check discount code application (3rd email)
- [ ] Complete checkout to verify cart completion

#### 3. **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Test with empty cart (should not send emails)
- [ ] Test expired recovery tokens
- [ ] Test multiple simultaneous carts
- [ ] Test cart merging on login

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run abandoned cart tests
npm run test:e2e -- abandoned-cart-e2e.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui abandoned-cart-e2e.spec.ts
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Database Optimization**
```sql
-- Add partial indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_active_carts ON carts(updated_at) 
WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX idx_abandoned_recent ON carts(abandoned_at) 
WHERE status = 'abandoned' 
AND abandoned_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Analyze tables after initial data
ANALYZE carts;
ANALYZE cart_items;
```

### 2. **Cart Sync Optimization**
```typescript
// In cartSync.ts, consider implementing:
// - Debounced syncing (already implemented with 1s delay)
// - Batch updates for multiple cart changes
// - Offline queue for sync when connection restored
```

### 3. **Email Sending Optimization**
- Batch process abandoned carts (max 50 per run)
- Implement retry mechanism for failed emails
- Use Resend's batch API for multiple recipients

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 1. **Token Security**
- Recovery tokens expire after 7 days
- Tokens are single-use only
- Use cryptographically secure random generation

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
```typescript
// Add to Edge Function
const MAX_EMAILS_PER_CART = 3
const MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_EMAILS = 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 6 hours
```

### 3. **Data Privacy**
- Implement unsubscribe mechanism
- Add consent checkbox for marketing emails
- Log all email activities for GDPR compliance

### 4. **Input Validation**
```typescript
// Validate recovery token format
if (!/^[a-f0-9-]{36}$/.test(token)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid token format')
}
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. **Key Metrics to Track**
```sql
-- Daily abandoned cart report
SELECT 
  DATE(abandoned_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as carts_abandoned,
  AVG(total_amount) as avg_cart_value,
  SUM(total_amount) as total_value
FROM carts
WHERE status = 'abandoned'
GROUP BY DATE(abandoned_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Email performance
SELECT 
  email_number,
  COUNT(*) as sent,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'opened' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as opened,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'clicked' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicked,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'converted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as converted
FROM abandoned_cart_emails
GROUP BY email_number;

-- Recovery rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'recovered' THEN 1 END)::float / 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'abandoned' THEN 1 END) * 100 as recovery_rate
FROM carts
WHERE abandoned_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### 2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
Create a Supabase dashboard or use external tools to monitor:
- Abandonment rate trends
- Email delivery rates
- Recovery conversion rates
- Revenue recovered

### 3. **Alert Thresholds**
- Alert if email delivery rate < 95%
- Alert if recovery rate drops below 5%
- Alert if Edge Function fails repeatedly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Emails Not Sending**
```bash
# Check Edge Function logs
supabase functions logs check-abandoned-carts

# Verify Resend API key
curl -X GET https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_RESEND_KEY"
```

#### 2. **Cart Not Syncing**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
console.log(localStorage.getItem('cart_session_id'))
console.log(localStorage.getItem('cart-storage'))

// Verify Supabase connection
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('carts').select('*')
```

#### 3. **Recovery Links Not Working**
```sql
-- Check token validity
SELECT * FROM cart_recovery_tokens 
WHERE token = 'YOUR_TOKEN' 
AND expires_at > NOW() 
AND used_at IS NULL;
```

#### 4. **High Abandonment Rate**
- Review checkout process friction points
- Analyze cart abandonment reasons via surveys
- Check for technical issues in checkout flow

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Find stuck abandoned carts
SELECT * FROM carts 
WHERE status = 'abandoned' 
AND abandoned_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM abandoned_cart_emails 
  WHERE cart_id = carts.id
);

-- Check email sending history
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.abandoned_at,
  COUNT(e.id) as emails_sent,
  MAX(e.sent_at) as last_email
FROM carts c
LEFT JOIN abandoned_cart_emails e ON c.id = e.cart_id
WHERE c.status = 'abandoned'
GROUP BY c.id, c.abandoned_at
ORDER BY c.abandoned_at DESC;
```
